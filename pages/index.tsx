          As tech advisor & enthusiast I can help you with <strong>tech strategy, concepts, tech leadership & coaching and hands-ons development</strong> (I don&apos;t like Loosing touch). Focus lies on helping startups getting from 0 to 1 and grown ups from 1 to 10. And I love architecting distributed & scaling systems.

        <h3>My Profile</h3>
        <p>
          Builder, Thinker & Communicator<br />
          with Passion for Innovation and Systems theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a builder my typical roles involve tech leadership, software architecture and fullstack. My love for designing solutions and technical excellence is combined with a strong bias for action. I have a track record of bringing ideas from 1 to 0 and scaling existing solutions to a global scale.
        </p><p>
          As a thinker I&apos; m your sparring partner. Next to technical perspective I also offer strong product and business sense. My experience ranges from many early stage and later stage projects I love to help conceptualize innovative digital solutions and evaluate business ideas and models.
        </p><p>
          As a communicator I build bridges and enable understanding between different groups: Collaboration between startups and big organizations. Between tech pros themselves or the evergreen triangle: between business, product and tech.
        </p><p>
          I thrive in high-paced and exploratory environments. They say I&apos;m an inspiring leader and I love helping people to grow as much as growing myself.
